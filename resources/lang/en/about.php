It is possible to notice that the dissemination of the subject is almost null and weak, because there is no incentive in schools and of the public.',
    'text2' => 'In internet we find large collections of astronomy\'s and striogusucs\'s subjects, yet this subject is difficult to learn and many times its dense and complicated, making the reading very wearisome, what causes a lack of disposal in the part of the student. ',
    'text3' => 'Many times, this subjects show images about the content and no explications, even having a legend, what makes things complicade because then it\'s necessary a larger knowlodge of the subject what is almost impossible at the time.',

    'text5' => 'That way, we decided to create a site where it would be possible to learn and understand in a interative and funny way, the complexes subjects related to astronomy and astrophysis, which would keep the user\'s attention and given the ease function wouldn\'t cause discouragement and disinterest.',
    'text6' => 'We noticed that a large part of the young public have a strong interest in games, an example would be the increasing in large scale of the e-sport in a mundial scenario, even adults have been interested in games at the present.',
    'text7' => 'Owing the great interest of the publid in games, we decided that the plataform should be a game. This game would approach the subjects in a dynamic and easy way, with the main focus being important discoverys and theories about the Cosmos, exploration missions, where which stage would be wrought to make the discoverys/theories something newsworthy, where the user would learn and have fun at the same time.',

    'text8' => 'With the implementation of the project we\'ll create a plataform that would offer high quality\'s subjects, making it easy to understand and being avaiable to everyone, so everyone can have somewhere to learn in a interative way with the content.',

We roll up the sleeve, visited the Municipal Planetarium of Campinas, in Taquaral. We searched a lot, we organized an equip with more than 40 people and realized one of the best projects of ETEC Pedro Ferreira Alves during the 2015\'s Expoete, there was even a row of people to visit the project and unfortunately a lot of them didn\'t get the change to see.',

    'text17' => 'It begins with little stand explainig a little about wich subject about the COSMOS and ends in a simulator, where everything exposed in the presentaions of the route will be reapresente in a resumed and visual way, bringing the sensations os spacial submersion in a closed and dark ambient. In this simulator, we have the presence of one person who will pretent to be the Captain of the ship, the same person who is reponsable to escort the visitors between the stands. It\'s not recomended to claustrophobic, people afraif of dark and people with heart issues.',
